# 5 Tips for Safe Package Delivery

Proper packaging is crucial for ensuring your items arrive safely. Here are our top tips for packaging your deliveries.

## 1. Choose the Right Box Size

Select a box that's slightly larger than your item, allowing room for cushioning material. A box that's too small won't provide adequate protection, while one that's too large may allow items to shift during transit.

## 2. Use Quality Cushioning

Fill empty spaces with:
- Bubble wrap
- Packing peanuts
- Crumpled paper
- Air pillows

This prevents items from moving and absorbs shock during handling.

## 3. Secure Fragile Items

For fragile items:
- Wrap each item individually
- Use "FRAGILE" labels
- Consider double-boxing valuable items
- Add extra cushioning on all sides

## 4. Seal Properly

Use strong packing tape to seal all openings:
- Apply tape along all seams
- Use the "H" taping method for extra security
- Avoid using string or paper tape

## 5. Label Clearly

Ensure your package has:
- Clear, legible address labels
- Return address information
- Any special handling instructions
- Contact phone numbers

Following these tips will help ensure your packages arrive safely every time!
